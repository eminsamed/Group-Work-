## Team work

Build a simple quiz in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
Add at least 5 questions to your quiz. Each question has 3-4 possible answers, where only 1 is correct. 
The questions should be about something you learned during the Powercoders bootcamp. 

Minimum features:
- show the questions in random order one after the other in the HTML
- let the user select an answer and give immediate feedback (right or wrong)
- let the user go to the next question
- at the end of the quiz show the score and give a message depending on the score (e.g. You are a genius / You seem to have a bad day)

What to think of:
- design: how does it look like / does it work on mobile? get some ideas online.
- additional features: can you make it more fun or easier to use?
- how to make the quiz semantically correct

Team work:
- discuss together what you have to do
- split the tasks (in pairs or single responsibles)
- put your code together and on GitHub
- present your quiz at the end of the day (5 to 10 min per group / every team member has to say something)

Estimated time: 2 hours 30 minutes <br>
plus presentation: 5 to 10 minutes <br>
Total points: 280
